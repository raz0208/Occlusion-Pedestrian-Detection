Occlusion Pedestrian Detection

## About Dataset
### Context
Cityscapes data (dataset home page) contains labeled videos taken from vehicles driven in Germany. This version is a processed subsample created as part of the Pix2Pix paper. The dataset has still images from the original videos, and the semantic segmentation labels are shown in images alongside the original image. This is one of the best datasets around for semantic segmentation tasks.
